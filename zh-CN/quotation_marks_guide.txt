Quotation Mark Conversion Guide for Chinese Translation
========================================================

STRAIGHT QUOTES (ASCII - to be converted):
------------------------------------------
Double quote: " (U+0022) - the standard keyboard double quote

LATEX QUOTATION MARKS (Target):
-------------------------------
Opening double quote: `` (two backticks) - renders as curly left quote
Closing double quote: '' (two single quotes/apostrophes) - renders as curly right quote

CONVERSION RULES:
-----------------
1. Straight " at start of quoted text  ->  ``
2. Straight " at end of quoted text    ->  ''

Example transformations in LaTeX source:
  "Hello"     ->  ``Hello''
  "type"      ->  ``type''

DETECTION HEURISTICS:
---------------------
Opening quote (use ``): After whitespace, punctuation, or at start of line
  - After: space, newline, (, [, {, etc.

Closing quote (use ''): After letters, numbers, Chinese characters
  - Before: space, punctuation, or end of text

CAUTION IN LATEX:
-----------------
- Don't convert quotes inside \verb or verbatim environments
- Don't convert quotes inside math mode ($...$)
- Don't convert quotes that are part of LaTeX commands

NOTE:
-----
LaTeX will automatically render:
  `` as the curly opening quote (the one that looks like 66)
  '' as the curly closing quote (the one that looks like 99)

This is the standard LaTeX convention for typographically correct quotation marks.
